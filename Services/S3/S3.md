# AWS::S3::Bucket

This AWS Cloudformation template is align with the below AWS Well-Architected principles:

* *Operational Excellence*: The S3 bucket is designed to be highly available and durable. Versioning is enabled to prevent accidental deletion or modification of objects. The bucket is also configured to block public access and to use server-side encryption to protect data.

* *Security*: The S3 bucket is set to private and public access is blocked using PublicAccessBlockConfiguration. Server-side encryption is enabled to protect data at rest. The CloudFormation template itself can be protected using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who can deploy it.

* *Reliability*: The S3 bucket is designed to be highly available and durable. Versioning is enabled to prevent data loss due to accidental deletion or modification.

* *Performance Efficiency*: The S3 bucket is designed to be highly scalable and performant. It can store a virtually unlimited amount of data and can handle high volumes of requests.

* *Cost Optimization*: The S3 bucket is designed to be cost-effective by using server-side encryption and lifecycle policies to move objects to lower-cost storage classes when they are no longer frequently accessed.
